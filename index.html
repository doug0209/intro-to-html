<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>Hello, my name is Randolphe Douge. I am a first year Graphic Design student at Algonquin College.I've been drawn in by the opportunities of visual communication ever since I picked up a pencil and started drawing, which is what first motivated me to apply to Algonquin's Graphic Design program. I became attracted to the prospect of turning ideas and concepts into attractive, eye-catching designs, and the program's blend of competence and creativity felt like the ideal mix. </p>

<p>I can honestly say that my love for design has only grown more since the end of my first semester. In addition to confirming my original motivation, the practical projects and exposure to different design software have increased my understanding of the value of teamwork and client-centered work in the industry.</p>
